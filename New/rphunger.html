 			            <h3 class="text-center">Introductory Note</h3>
 			            <p>The series of developments that have marked the emergence of India as a pivotal component in the global
 			dynamic is indeed remarkable. A country that embarked on its path with engrained challenges to national
 			integrity and security along with economic stability, has certainly treaded far from such adversities in the
 			past few decades. However, scrutiny at the grassroot level unveils a rather different picture where many
 			are refrained from the most fundamental requisites of survival including a balanced diet, potable water
 			and basic sanitation. The 2017 Global Hunger Index, a cumulative index with child stunting, wasting,
 			undernourishment and mortality as an indicator, has placed India at the 100th place out of 119 nations
 			behind a majority of its South Asian counterparts.1 These concerns coupled with the nationwide
 			instability among the people core to the agricultural sector, raises some serious questions.
 			</p>

 			<p>A country that aims to seek parity with the global superpowers, certainly needs to address the issue in an
 			optimal and fool-proof manner. The current central and state level initiatives, have made significant
 			inroads while tackling the issue however, the execution still faces challenges like efficient distribution,
 			exchequer burden and more importantly, complimenting the present stock grains with the essential dietary
 			compliments to suffice the nutritional requisites. India being a state party to the Universal Declaration of
 			Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is obligated to
 			ensure the right to adequate food and eradicate hunger.
 			</p>
 			            <p>Government programs like the Mid-Day Meal Scheme, Integrated Child Development Services scheme
 			and the Public Distribution System have now been translated into legal entitlements by means of the
 			National Food Security Act, 2013 which extends its reach to nearly two-thirds of the population.2 NFSA
 			along with a few handful of state initiatives comprise the food security mechanism of the country. The further sections will aim to examine the
 			loopholes and implications of the structure and consequently, provide inputs to streamline the system
 			along with the complimenting policy implications.
 			</p>
 			            <h3 class="text-center">Provisional Layout: National Food Security Act, 2013</h3>

 			<p>Food security has been a concern for the country’s policy makers and has received scrutiny and
 			accordingly various measures have been adopted. By the end of the year 2000, Antyodaya Anna Yojana
 			was implemented in Rajasthan and by 2004, it expanded across the country. The scheme guaranteed up to
 			35 kilograms of wheat and rice at the subsidized rates of Rs.2 and Rs.3 respectively. Building upon the
 			groundwork laid out by the Antyodaya Anna Yojana, National Food Security Act came into the picture in
 			the year 2013 and expanded the size of beneficiaries to two-thirds of the population. (75% of the rural and
 			half of the urban population)</p>


 			<p>The most significant development under the NFSA, 2013 was the emergence of food as a basic human
 			right and its accompanied implication on the state to guarantee such a basic entitlement. Also dubbed as
 			the “Right to Food”, the NFSA entitled an individual up to 5 kilograms of wheat, rice and millet at
 			subsidized rates. Furthermore, the issue of undernourishment has been tackled by means of provision of
 			free meals to pregnant and lactating women along with children below the age of six through the
 			anganwadi channel to meet the nutritional requirements.3 NFSA also was marked by a series of reforms
 			aimed for supply chain streamlining, transparency and engagement of public bodies like panchayats,
 			SHGs and co-operatives in the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS).
 			</p>

 			            <h3 class="text-center">Present Challenges to Food Security</h3>


 			<p>The essence of food security lies with the ability to ensure that food is available, accessible, utilizable and
 			has a stable supply. The availability and stability of food supply depend majorly on the agricultural
 			produce which is further subjected to an array of meteorological factors in a country like India. However,
 			utility and accessibility require intervention at the governance level.
 			Food supply holds utility when its able to suffice the dietary requirements of an individual. Consequently,
 			it requires a significant chunk of scrutiny to ensure that the subsidized stock fulfils these dietary requisites
 			which is obviously subject to the economic potency of the government. Furthermore, accessibility can be
 			ensured by means of a streamlined supply-chain and the accompanied policy measures.

 			</p>
 			<p>The demographic expanse of India however, has made the implementation phase emerge as a massive
 			challenge for the promising act. The provision of subsidized grains to the two thirds of the population is
 			itself a massive burden on the exchequer which amounts to Rs. 1,45,339 crores according to the 2017-18
 			budget estimates.5 This also has made India face global friction considering the fact that it breaches the
 			WTO limit of 10 per cent on agricultural produce as subsidy.6 This has forced India to assert a global
 			stance to update the reference prices to lay a check on the subsidy percentages.
 			</p>
 			<p>Furthermore, policy failures like biometric linkage by Aadhaar and Direct Benefit Transfer left many
 			people refrained from the status of a beneficiary, thus, worsening the case. While the intent behind the
 			latter policies was to counter the usage of forged ration cards, the implementation turned out to be rather
 			premature. The rejection of ration cards without sparing an adequate prior window to ensure seeding of
 			Aadhar cards highlighted a big flaw in the whole Public Distribution System.</p>

 			<p>The government has invited harsh criticism after such implementation failures which were specially
 			triggered after the death of the 11 year old Santoshi Kumari from Jharkhand due to starvation. A state that
 			claimed ‘100 percent seeding’ in 2017 actually has covered a mere 1.7 crore out of 2.3 crore beneficiaries,
 			which implies the denial of 6 million individuals from the scheme.7 The Direct Benefit Transfer however,
 			is arguably the biggest loophole in the new PDS system. Under the DBT system, the beneficiaries are
 			entitled to a cash amount as a subsidy which in turn is used to buy ration at regular rates.8 Such measures
 			engrain inefficiency in the system and moreover, portray a less sensitive administration. On the brighter
 			side, AAP played as a pioneer of sensitive and responsible governance by calling off the Aadhar system
 			temporarily to allow ration to 2.5 lakh Delhi families which were previously denied due to Aadhar data
 			discrepancy</p>

 			<h3 class = "text-center">Eradication of Hunger: Methodology</h3>
 			<p>Eradicating hunger indeed requires high priority dealings since failure to do so implies denial of food to a
 			significant chunk of population. Hence, during a tenure of five years a government must consider an agenda of “complete hunger eradication” and compliment the same with the
 			policy reforms, legislative changes and finances. Prior to the formulation of any solution, the
 			understanding of the layout of the food supply remains critical. In other words, the series of steps that
 			make the farm to table journey possible need to checked, optimized and streamlined by means of policy
 			reform and has to be backed financially. To elaborate further, we may divide the food supply chain into
 			three major chunks, i.e. production, transition and distribution. Furthermore, two peripheral stages, which
 			are storage and the formulation of a balanced diet, require scrutiny for attaining a holistic food security
 			program. </p>

 			<p>The primary step for hunger eradication is ensuring that there is enough food stock present for the people.
 			In an agro-based economy like ours, self-sufficiency in the form of edible crops is a must. Consequently,
 			measures are required to increase or maintain a stable rate of agricultural produce. Moreover, ensuring the
 			welfare of the producer is a must. Indian agricultural sector is sensitive to various factors which are
 			majorly meteorological, for instance, 40% of the Indian population is still supported by rainfed
 			agriculture.10 This implies a population highly prone to droughts and spiraling debts which calls for
 			appropriate measures for farmer protection. Thus, the first step for hunger eradication is farmer protection
 			which calls for expanding the kisan credit systems, subsidy on interest rates and a holistic insurance
 			system.</p>


 			<p>Following the procurement of food stock, it requires to be funneled into distribution channels in an
 			optimal manner which implies a need for minimization of logistical losses along with ensuring time
 			bound delivery to the destinations. This calls for infrastructural inputs in the form of roads and agro-based
 			markets. This fiscal year’s budget allocated Rs 2,000 crores as an Agri-Market Infrastructure Fund for
 			evolving and upgrading agricultural marketing infrastructure in the current 22,000 Grameen Agricultural
 			Markets (GrAMs) and 585 APMCs.11 Furthermore, the proposed MSP calculation methodology making
 			it 1.5 times the A2+FL costs portray positive strides subject to its implication on the exchequer. An
 			ambitious shift shift to C2 methodology, however, still seems far- fetched which can potentially
 			quadruple farmer returns but also means a 40 percent rise in exchequer burden
 			</p>
 			<p>Finally, the most important segment, i.e. distribution comes under consideration. Its pivotal to understand
 			the intricate and sensitive nature of this whole supply chain due to the support it extends to the
 			beneficiaries. Any failure or a policy loophole in schemes like Aadhar seeding or DBT may eventually
 			lead starvation and thus, radical consequences. Presently, the streamlining of the distribution channels can
 			be achieved by means of strategically laying out the public fair price shops. DBT though a potential remedy for the exchequer has
 			failed due to the excess travel time added by the additional step in the form of bank transaction. This can
 			be tackled by means of investing in banks and distribution centers being established in close proximity.
 			Furthermore, the digitization procedures to make the distribution process free of fraudulent activities must
 			go through checks and balances before assertive implementation.

 			</p>


 			<h3 class = "text-center">5. Peripheral Solutions</h3>
 			<p>Along with the above methodology, peripheral aids certainly need to be looked upon to bolster the
 			proficiency of the hunger eradication program. A few of them have been listed in this section </p>

 			<h4>5.1 Reliance on Green Box Subsidies</h4>
 			<p>Green box subsidies, i.e. subsidies that have no trade intervention or price support, like research
 			infrastructure, farmer training, disaster aid and so on must be promoted. This makes the food security
 			program more self sufficient and removes burden from the exchequer. Notably, India’s reliance on amber
 			box subsidies which include price subsidy at both the input and output ends has invited friction at the
 			WTO</p>

 			<h4>5.2 Examining the Scope of Co-operatives and SHGs</h4>

 			<p>Formation of Co-operatives and Self Help Groups holds promise in all stages of food supply and has
 			proven to be successful in the past. Such initiatives help providing a financial cushion to the stakeholders
 			and engrain a sense of empowerment and protection.

 			</p>

 			<h4>5.3 Promotion of Decentralized Procurement</h4>


 			<p>Instead of producing for the food security program across the country, logistical costs can be trimmed by
 			localizing production. This makes the functioning of the program hassle- free and reduces financial and
 			administrative burden.
 			</p>

 			<h4>5.4 Storage Infrastructure</h4>

 			<p>Owing to an unstable supply and a weather sensitive produce, it is highly important to create and store a
 			buffer stock in times of adversities to cushion the supply and price fluctuation due to adverse factors.
 			Investments on cold-storages and warehouses hold the key.

 			</p>

 			<h4>5.5 Creation of a Nutritionally Potent Food Supply</h4>

 			<p>While the current food schemes have made the stock grains available to a significant number of
 			beneficiaries, meeting the calorific and nutritional requirements still seems far- fetched. India still needs
 			to tread on expanding its food processing sector. Furthermore, animal husbandry and fishery sector receiving a budget allocation of Rs. 10,000 Crores holds promise for
 			meeting the nutritional requisites across the country. Green revolution taking shape of a protein revolution
 			indeed will bend the proceedings to a brighter side
 			</p>



 			<h3 class = "text-center">6. Eradicating Hunger: A Five-Year Approach</h3>
 			<p>The strides towards complete eradication of hunger can be boosted by means of a well laid out five year
 			plan. Even though deemed to be an ambitious approach, it holds promise and the results would be purely
 			subjected to the beforehand research and implementation. The approach can be broken down into four
 			major steps
 			</p>

 			<h4>6.1 Beneficiary Identification and Classification</h4>

 			<p>Prior to actual distribution, beneficiaries would be needed to get classified on the basis of their buying
 			potency and accordingly, subsidies should be allocated. This will involve extensive surveying and
 			complimenting data analysis for supply computation.

 			</p>

 			<h4>6.2 Supply Inventory Formation</h4>

 			<p>Following the computation and analysis required, a resource supply inventory would have to be created
 			for funneling the supply into distribution channels. This requires demographical insights in target region
 			along with optimal locations for an efficient setup.</p>

 			<h4>6.3 Distribution Channeling</h4>

 			<p>A simple and hassle-free channel for final distribution needs to be ensured to achieve the desired goals in
 			a span of five years. Merging digital trends along with an adequate human intervention would prove to be
 			crucial for safe yet quick dealing.

 			</p>
 			<h4>6.4 Feedback Intake and Statistical Inference</h4>

 			<p>Owing to the time crunch, the demographic and economic response of the program would need to be
 			recorded at a high frequency. Consequently, employing statistics for formulating further maneuvers holds
 			key.


 			</p>

 			<h3 class = "text-left"><u>Conclusion</u></h3>

 			<p>Eradicating hunger needs to be perceived as a time-bound task with sensitive implications. While
 			planning and intent for the same has proven to be commendable over the years, a sensitive and
 			responsible implementation needs to be consolidated at the earliest. Further inroads must be formed into
 			the addition of nutrient rich supplements to the stock grains for tackling undernourishment. Most
 			importantly, in the coming years, rather than a welfare based program, scrutiny must be devoted for
 			achieving a self sufficient population for supporting the nation.</p>
