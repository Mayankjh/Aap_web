				            <h3 class="text-center">"The modern world, for better or worse, springs from Europe."</h3>
				            <p>Europe is the continent that gave birth to the concept of democracy, politics and citizenship. The Industrial revolution is yet another by product that has now taken forms such as globalisation, basically the promulgation of borderless economy or the white globe concept. It is an amalgamation of 28 European Countries governed by common economic, social and security policies. The EU was created by the Maastricht Treaty, came into force on November 1, 1993. The formation of European continent was characterised by numerous geographically proximate states and people. The reason for this lies in the geography of the region. Europe's major rivers like Danube do not meet. This partly explains why Europe comprises of so many countries in a relatively smaller space. For Instance The Danube Basin produces geographical advantages of terrain, the interconnection of rivers provide natural borders alongwith the benefit of navigation. As a result, encouraging greater chances of economic influence in world trade system. This has been accompanied by political-economic measures such as creation of a uniform currency (Euro). However, this has led to both creation of ties and tensions in the continent. The source for the latter was the management of Europe's intrinsic diversities.
				In the current scenario, headlines such as the Greece repression, Eurozone crisis, Question of Turkey's membership or the deliberation behind the Brexit have exposed EU to leakages and cracks that are widening annually. This report aims to identify the irritants behind the same. The major focus of the report shall revolve around how the reshuffling of Europe's political geography is taking place in four paradigms:The Reshuffling of Elite Countries that set the foundation stones for the Union. Secondly, how the history has been profitable to the northern europe than those in the south for several centuries. The industrialisation of north before the south has been responsible for the divide. Thirdly, the shrinking core and the enlargement of periphery countries. The countries that perceived themselves as the heart of Europe have now been relegated to insignificant status due to their low economic performance. In addition to this, there has emerged a division between creditor and debtor states creating bitter scuffles, encouraging the creditor nations to withdraw from EU. Fourthly, the shifting central command from Brussels to Germany economically has been causing grave insecurities for France in the backdrop of Franco-Prussian War. This has led to a Union without any strong central authority, incapable of holding it together. The final observation is lack of a common shared vision of European Integration. Implying, people identify with their countries and not with the idea of being an European. It must be noted that a similar phenomenon was observed before the disintegration of soviet union.

				The paper is a sum of divergence and convergence amongst the member states of EU and the related cleavages. Alongwith, the friction of market integration against social cohesion.
				</p>
				            <h3 class="text-center">Introduction</h3>
				<p>Over the past decade, the European Union has been going through a situation of break down due to its eurozone crisis. Established political parties are finding it tough survive on the ideology of an integrated European Identity. Beginning from Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and more recently Italy these countries have now become the receiver countries flooded with massive borrowing costs. Since the economy of the continent is architectured to be highly interconnected, interdependent there is a spillover effect from the debtor nations to the creditor nations. The crisis is taking more evolved and destructive forms- a banking crisis and then an economic crisis into an acute political crisis.

				Such a situation is the exact opposite of what the founders of the union expected it to be during the 1999. The biggest feature of the union was the single monetary policy which was perceived as a symbol of political and social integration. The use of a common currency allowed for increased cross-border competition, integration and efficiency in the market for goods, services and capital. Implying a greater price stability, therefore promoting the  attractiveness as a trading and investment currency.
				Considering the spillover effect that has for long been agitating the richer countries in EU, the phase of palliatives must fade. It is important to understand that the crisis is not merely of sovereign debt and bank financials but deep seated in the structural problems of national economies.
				</p>
				            <h3 class="text-center">Literature Review </h3>
				            <p>The power dynamics of European Union within and externally have for long been the political discourse.Duchêne (1972) coined the concept of “civilian power” for EU due to its inclination towards soft power and the new qualitative aspects in the international arena. Implying a non-military approach to management of international disputes.
				In addition to this,  Manners (2002) labelled the EU as a “normative power” that has influenced the actions of political actors by diffusion instead of coercion or rewarding. On the other hand Manners, Damro (2012) define EU's identity as “not a particular set of collective norms but rather a comparatively large regulated market” which is not about containing the diversities but rather the imposition of the dominant political discourse.
				The common ground between these  conflicting conceptions is that all of them indicate the growth of the union influence both externally and internally. This can be supported by 2001 Kupchan observed that EU has the potential of becoming “new pole of power”directly challenging the unipolarity US seems to behold. Moreover, other scholars such as Reid  viewed the EU as a “second superpower that can stand on equal footing with the United States” (Reid 2004: 1). Moravcsik followed the trail(2009) for him, Europe was the world’s “pre-eminent civilian power and its second military power”
				Given in the era of democracy, the risks of military confrontations have fallen there is a greater need for deployment of civilian power has risen. Therefore, European Union plays a strategic role in promotion of same.
				</p>
				            <h3 class="text-center">Identification of Leakages  </h3>
				<p>This section can be divided into three major leakages supported by member specific case studies. </p>
				<u>The reshuffling of the elites</u>
				<p>The impact of Euro Crisis has been multi directional both on domestic as well as foreign policy. The impetus for this has been largely on the basis national public opinion. Ironically, the governing elites of european nations are unable to accomodate the support for integration that is essential for the great european dream. This does not imply that elites are incapable of shaping public opinion, but in the long run they cannot gather support for public policies that electorally rejected. Surprisingly, this trend has been initiated by the most traditionally pro european countries such as Germany, Finland and Greece. As George Pagoulatos’s paper in this collection points out, by spring 2012 14 percent more Greeks considered the EU a “bad” thing than a “good” thing. This is a reversal of the situation over the previous two decades, when the gap between those with a positive view of the EU compared to a negative view reached highs of over 60 percent. As a result of this traditional pro European parties face a potential threat of losing mandate to new parties such as radical left (Syriza) in Greece, the Freedom Party in the Netherlands, the True Finns Party, the Danish People’s Party, the UK Independence Party, or Italy’s Five Star Movement. They have dogmatically adopted anti-European positions and even condemned their own coalition governments, threatening the stability of democracy.
				However, the current public mood may transform with an emergence of stability and growth in the area. The looming question of brexit is yet another by product of the lack of fulfilment of national aspirations of Britain. This has a spillover effect to, the end result is national brinkmanship and culture of veto.
				</p>
				<u>The shrinking core and the growing periphery </u>
				<p>Like a slow poison, the european members have abandoned the fiction that all states are equal and that it is important to respect national diversities and ethnicities. This has led to creation of new divisions namely- Core and Periphery Countries. The core countries focus on production and manufacture of goods whereas the periphery countries are house to underutilized raw materials and market for finished goods.
				This phenomenon has created even founder members at the receiving end. Italy one of the biggest economies in Europe has been placed into political receivership. Italy's economic problems are rooted in the political dysfunctionality, it can be drawn that politics of the country is a greater irritant than the economy itself. It has a febrile political system, with new parties contesting and disappearing, fusing, breaking apart, changing names and shifting allegiances. In Addition to this, In Italy both the left and the right identify growth with public spending, therefore showing aversion towards market opening reforms. Eventually, creating coordinates of conflict between Italy and the central authorities in the union.
				The central authority or the creditor states have assumed the role of an executioner rather than an ecourager, undermining the public image of politicians in the debtor states.
				Another example of this similar phenomenon is the case of Spain. Pressure is exerted on the nation to enforce austerity measures and meet nominal deficit reduction targets. Austerity measures imposed in the country have only contributed to rising sovereign debts. Therefore, depriving the country of the advantages of privatisation. This has severely rampaged the unity of the country, in the Catalan political elite, resenting the loss due to austerity measures have joined the secessionist camp. This led to the government(under pressure) conducted referendum on the question of Spanish United Territory.
				Another issue is growing anxiousness in new member states such as Poland and Bulgaria. They do not fear Euroscepticism but the fear that the multi directional speed of europe will relegate into a peripheral status. Furthermore, the negotiations regarding the future of eurozone are not transparent has advanced their suspicion and insecurity. Bulgaria has been caught in the disadvantage of becoming the member right before the eurozone crisis, without any time to absorb the benefits and security of EU. Likewise they consider eurozone plans to create separate meetings of their MEPs as depriving them of access to key decisions.
				</p>
				<u>A centre that cannot hold  </u>
				<p>A central authority is vital for the integration and creation of legitimate restrains for the members of any union. But, when then starts to fall apart or shift either the union is to strengthen further or break down to ruins. In case of Europe the most crucial decisions in past few years have been taken without considering the European Parliament or European commission. Their role has come down to that of a postman, delivering messages from one European capital to another. Germany has evolved into a key player however the political mood of the country suggests otherwise. The European Council's function is merely to rubberstamp German led proposals and directives. Germany's biggest concern is that of creating a hierarchy of dominance to compensate the growing liabilities in other peripheral countries. As a result, Merkel policies are guided towards strict rules, austerity and sanctions than about flexibility and incentives. Creating a sharp contrast with the French vision and resulting in a balance of power situation.
				The French way forward is the gradual process of deeper political, economic and social integration in presence of supranational forms of solidarity such as EUROBONDS, followed by institutional changes. This is completely different from the Merkel vision that promulgates institutional changes before any form of supranational form of solidarity.
				The frustration of the austerity policies in states such as Spain Italy have been accelerating rapidly and cannot be countered by balance of power (or coalition of losers) because german cooperation is essential to solve their home economic crisis.
				</p>

				<h3 class = "text-center">MAJOR ECONOMIC ISSUES (INTRINSIC TO EU)</h3>
				<p>By 2011, the eurozone crisis turned predominantly into a sovereign debt crisis intricately woven with bank debt and claims across borders within and outside the monetary union.</p>
				<u>A Monetary Union without a Fiscal Union; Lack of adherence</u>
				<p>The introduction of Euro in 1999 led to an arrangement that encouraged similar fiscal path but did not establish a mechanism for common treasury to implement it. This allowed for possibility of fiscal free riding the major impetus for the Greece Crisis. The structural differences between core and peripheral economies were ignored which led latter unable to comply with the economic standards initially agreed upon.  Had there been a fiscal union, with a system horizontal transfer and controls, the deficit and debt ratio of the peripheral economies may have been contained. In current scenario, the fiscal crisis in countries like Greece have not received positive encouragement. Since, the central economies are not empowered to act as the lender of last resort.Therefore, codes and conducts are incomprehensive if not supported by proper incentives to adhere to them.  </p>
				<u>Varying productivity and Structural Differences </u>
				<p>The euro zone apart from national diversities also is choked rather nurtured by economic disparities in terms of variation in productivity. For instance, when compared to Germany peripheral economies have much lower labor productivity. Only France and Ireland are able to compete with Germany.  </p>

				<div class="container">
				    <img src="img/rpsocial1.jpg" class="img-responsive thumbnail">
				        <img src="img/rpsocial2.jpg" class="img-responsive thumbnail">

				</div>
				<p>The differences can be exasperated when these economies confront asymmetric shocks and the efficient economies are unable to contain the losses incurred by the weaker ones.  Large fiscal deficit and  public debt with interconnected and weak banking systems can then make matters worse if debt is held across borders which is an issue we deal with shortly.
				It is obvious how lack of labor productivity has a direct bearing on the unemployment rates of both countries individually and as a part of the collective European Union.  As compared to the peripheral economies, Germany has the lowest rate of unemployment rate due to its short-time working scheme and flexible time arrangements in the manufacturing sector.
				</p>
				<u>Role of cross border lending; a glue to peripheral countries </u>
				<p>The success of the European from 1999 till the present is directly dependent on the ability to maintain fiscal discipline by its member nations. Further, leading to beholding trust and greater investment in market. Unfortunately, it is this uniform monetary policy and the currency that has led to the complexity of the crisis. </p>
				<div class="container">
				    <img src="img/rpsocial3.jpg" class="img-responsive thumbnail">

				</div>
				<p>This foregoing integration is seen in terms of the large share of public debt held across borders with European banks (German, French, British and others) having cross border exposure. Data from the Bank of International settlements gives an indication of the magnitude of exposure for major economies in the eurozone.It is this large exposure depicted above that restrains the european banks to shy away from their involvement in peripheral economies. Therefore, making them inevitable and potential parasites.

				</p>
				<h3 class = "text-center">Parameters to monitor the effects of decline of European Union </h3>
				<p>This section encompasses with the nature of EU's power. It assumes the power dynamics of the union multi-fold/multidimensional. The following parameters are defined in terms of whether EU is capable of influencing the behaviour of other actors, prevalent in the international arena. There are majorly three fundamental forms of power in Geopolitics namely- military power, economic or financial power and the ideological or the soft power. </p>
				<div class="container">
				    <img src="img/rpsocial4.jpg" class="img-responsive thumbnail">

				</div>
				<p>To assess trend of power possession following parameters can be considered: </p>
				<u>Security and Defence Policy </u>
				<p>During the 1990s the immense bloodshed and human rights violation in Yugoslavia which escalated into a war made EU realise its complete dependence on US to establish security again. Since, the situation was in immediate neighbourhood of Europe leading to realisation that military intervention capacity is paramount for survival. Fifteen years after the war in Kosovo, Eu's capability to supply hard power especially in the case of Macedonia has risen subsequently.
				However, In Egypt it tried but couldn't establish a common ground between a Muslim Brotherhood president and the military. Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates have been considered as major players in failure of this maneuver. Similarly, in the Syrian civil war it has only played the role of a sidekick making its effort almost futile.
				Technically Speaking, the european defence spending has fallen by 10 percent between 2005 to 2010 which further declined by 10 percent in 2013 (European Commission 2013). In addition to this, its capability to provide hard power can also be blamed to the security crises among the member states for example in case of Iraq in 2003, Libya in 2012 or Syria. A recent study has also concluded that  “in the last 10 years, the EU has lost the sense of common purpose and shared ambition that marked the start of the European defence enterprise” (de France and Witney 2013: 2)
				Another interesting observation is that though EU has been unable to control the Kosovo-Serbia crises by the means of soft power, but it certainly influenced the issue by the usage of accession card. It threatened the aspirations of Serbian government to EU membership. This allowed EU to mediate an intractable dispute between Kosovo and Serbia over the status of majority ethnic Serbian districts in Kosovo in 2013.
				</p>
				<u>Promotion of Democracy and Human Rights </u>
				<p>Many scholars have quoted EU as a normative power especially in promotion of democracy across continent. But the important question is that can it still influence ailing democracies despite being in the bottleneck itself?
				Political events and the process of democratization have all indicated that best protection of security is in a world well governed by democratic states. For instance, the usage of EU accession card. This influenced various candidate states to legitimately accommodate the ethnic minorities. But, since 2004 among the states that are situated in western Balkans(that remain outside EU) the liberal democratic norms are now deaccelerating. Moreover, in face of Russia's anxious annexation of Crimea (in order to safeguard its bufferzone by military force) has highlighted the importance of EU both as a soft and hard power.
				The specific impact of the EU in respect of the promotion of human rights may be best assessed by analyzing issues – such as the work of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the abolition of the death penalty (Manners 2002: 245-52) – where EU initiatives were opposed or not supported by the US. The number of countries imposing the death penalty fell during the last decade, from 86 in 2000 to 58 in 2012 (Le Monde 2013a). In the 1990s, however, before the EU began to campaign internationally against the death penalty, the decline – from initially 124 states - had been faster. This suggests that, although the EU may have contributed to this process, its role was not decisive. The by products of this epic failure can be clearly seen in countries like Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia,  USA and above all China.
				</p>
				<u>Promotion of regional cooperation and integration  </u>
				<p>The EU has vigorously advocated and has claimed to act as an epitome for regional cooperation.The creation of regional corporations such as  North Atlantic Free Trade Area (NAFTA), the South American Mercosur, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations (ANZCER) have been directly motivated by the single currency project of the 1999.
				In the wake of eurozone and other fiscal crises, the influence has started to chip-off. The question of creation of a common currency in other regional corporations has been entirely done away with. Thus attacking the decisive image of European Union. In Asian eyes, for example, it has turned from being an “economic giant and powerhouse” into a “hobbled economic giant” (Chaban and Holland: 2013). It can be safely said that the 1990s was golden age and a fertile ground for regional cooperation. But, too much water/internal friction has led to a complete reversal of the success during those times. EU instead of being a generator of multilateral agreements is only producing bilateral agreements with individual member states.
				</p>
				<u>Environment Lobby </u>
				<p>Kyoto Protocol to curb worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. It rigorously indulged in the lobby of this particular agreement despite the aversion produced by United States.
				However, it is observed that its influence as a green power is diminishing. This can be elucidated by the Copenhagen Summit 2009. The summit failed to produce any comprehensive legal restrictions on its signatories but it also compromised the presence of any EU state. Rather, the participants comprised US president Obama and his counterparts from China, India, Brazil and India. The EU had no input into the minimal accord that was reached and of which the Commission president allegedly heard via a text message. For the EU, the summit was labelled variously as a “humiliation” (Lehmann 2010) or – by the minister chairing the EU Council at the time – as a “great failure” and “disaster” (Financial Times 2009).
				Moreover, the recent effort by EU to ensure compliance of Indian and Chinese airlines towards carbon emission trading rules is yet another saga of its waning influence as a global green player.
				</p>

				<h3 class = "text-center">A Solution Towards or Away from EUROPEAN UNION </h3>
				<p>The possible alternatives to deal with the eurozone crisis can be classified into three options. The first option is that of adoption of austerity measures voluntarily, especially fiscal consolidation, including privatization. But in practice this is bound to incur social costs as we have seen in the case of states like Greece, Spain, France and Italy. The peripheral economies are bound to fall in trap of the imbalance between revenue and expenditure, often latter executing the other. Eventually leading to cumbersome private debts that eventually result in public debts. The argument given by liberals that the market forces will resolve their internal crisis stands failed in the current scenario. This option conveniently ignores the social and structural differences that are inherent in these lagging economies. Therefore, the short term economic sanctions and further bailouts is only to increase the agony of the union.

				The second option is an imperative one that strives for a closer fiscal union as encouraged by French leadership. Assisted with an enlarged European Budget, limitations on transfers by rich nations to poor, better incentives for increasing productivity of employment. Germany can illustrate a great example in this regard as it did during  German Unification by accommodating the Eastern Germany and its inefficient labor force. If not a complete convergence that is bound to crack at times of stress there can be a formation of an institutional framework that permits a multi speed europe.

				The third option is a radical one and has a high potential of becoming a reality if nothing above works. Basically, the peripheral economies leaving the eurozone. A breakdown of the currency may be a very expensive proposition. But if that were to happen, it could lead to insolvency of several Euro zone countries, a breakdown in intra zone payments. Given that public debt in these countries is present in the balance sheets of banks and insurance companies across the world, contagion effects and instability could spread through the financial system. In comparison, the sub-prime crisis may almost pale into insignificance (Pagano, 2010, Eichengreen 2007).
				</p>
				<h3 class = "text-center">Executive Summary </h3>
				<p>Unfortunately, Europe can't escape the complex nature of the crisis without resolving at the foundational level. The continent requires not just sanctions but comprehensive incentives for adherence and membership. New cooperatives schemes open for all and not just for some nations is the need of the hour. Which requires consideration towards diversities on the basis of social identities and economic standing. EU must revert towards a multilateral approach rather than a bilateral or worse unilateral approach. This also requires some kind of new social contract between Europeans rather than just another intergovernmental treaty.
				As discussed above, the three options are not simple enough to implement or gather support for. The choices have to be political but the result is going to be monetary.Rather, to make the choice on ‘The Euro’ – as Eichengreen put it, to ‘love it or to leave it’ and depending on that, to do what needs to done.
